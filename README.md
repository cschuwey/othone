# Othonè

Welcome to Othonè, the [Early Modern Digital Library](othone.org). Othonè (both "screen" and "sail" in Greek) joined her sisters as the Muse of digital editions. She inspires us to make the most of the screen and the digital tools to provide new insights into Early Modern books and texts. 

Christophe Schuwey is head of the digital library. He is an Associate professor of Digital Humanities and Book History at the University of South Brittany (France). 

Each folder corresponds to a different edition or database, and contains files made public (such as texts encoded in XML-TEI). Feel free to use these files for your own text mining, digital editions, NLP, editorial and other projects. Please note that many of these files are a work in progress and might lack proper meta-data.
